# WORKING PAPERS

1. **[The Hedging Channel of Exchange Rate Determination](../papers/HedgingChannelofExchangeRate_Latest.pdf)**, joint with [Tony Zhang](https://sites.google.com/view/tzhang0/home?authuser=0)

    We show that currency hedging links external imbalances to exchange rate movements, cross-currency basis, and currency option skew.

2. **[U.S. Banks and Global Liquidity](https://conference.nber.org/conf_papers/f142383.pdf)**, joint with [Ricardo Correa](https://sites.google.com/view/ricardocorrea/home) and [Wenxin Du](https://sites.google.com/site/wenxindu/)

    We show that ample reserves are the key to support global banks’ dollar lending in money markets.
